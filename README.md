# sparkbulb

An tiny example Apache Spark program for presentation at the Houston Spark Meetup.

This was converted to Scala from mandelbulb.js http://royvanrijn.com/blog/2012/07/introducing-mandelbulb-js/.

Run "env MASTER=local[*] mvn verify" to generate a webm movie. Open frames/t.webm after the run.

# Why?

This is intended to be a more fun way to learn Spark than "word count". :^)

# Presentation
